    <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>We are a small group of young coding enthusiasts. The ideas were first came up by Keegan Tan and Lau Yin Hyang. They have been creating War Games in class since 2023. They have found changing stats too difficult with exams coming up. Thus, they combined two of their war games into Royal's War! 😊 Enjoy Playing!</p>
